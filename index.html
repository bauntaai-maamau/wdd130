            <p>Hi! Welcome to my page. My name is Bauntaai and I am from Onotoa, Kiribati. If this is 
               the first time for you to learn about Kirbati, please refer to the picture below with a 
               brief background provided below it.
               I started my BYU Pathway Worldwide journey at the beginning of 2023 with a goal to
               complete my Computer Science Program. From a young age I realized that I enjoyed working 
               with numbers so I might say I enjoy working with numbers more than writing an essay or a written
               report or something.
               I also enjoy learning new skills like playing tennis and learning to play the piano. 
               I am excited to learn with all of you in this course and 'Tekeraoi' which means I wish you all the best. 
            </p>

            <p>Kiribati is an island nation in the central Pacific Ocean, consisting of 33 atolls and reef islands, spread across 3.5 million square kilometers. Its capital is South Tarawa. The country's population is around 120,000, and it gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1979. Kiribati is divided into three main island groups, often referred to as states: Gilbert Islands: This is the most populous group, containing the capital, South Tarawa. Phoenix Islands: This group is less populated and includes islands like Canton (Kanton) Island and Enderbury Island. It's known for the Phoenix Islands Protected Area, one of the world's largest marine protected areas. And last but not least The Line Islands: These are the easternmost islands of Kiribati, including Kiritimati (Christmas Island), Tabuaeran (Fanning Island), and Teraina (Washington Island). Kiritimati is the world's largest coral atoll by land area. </p>
